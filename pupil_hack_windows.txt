used the main branch, followed the instructions both here:

had to change line 35 of  pupil_src\shared_modules\atb\raw.py to
	dll_path = ctypes.util.find_library('AntTweakBar64')
if you are all 32 bit, this is not necessary

		dll_path = find_library('glfw3')

previously, it was 'glfw' -- which is not the name of the library on windows
